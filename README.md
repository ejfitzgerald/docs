## Instructions for building the documentation locally

To compile and build the documentation site locally, download and install mkdocs. Instructions are <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation" target=_blank>here</a>.

Then, clone the version of the docs you are interested in, `cd` to the `docs` root, and run `mkdocs build`, then `mkdocs serve`.

Have fun.
